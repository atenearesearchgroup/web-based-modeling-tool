# ES6 capabilities
- Since 2019:

# Advantages
- Less use of prototyping everywhere.
- The diagram is sacalable:
    - JointJS+ uses SVG (The Scalable Vector Graphics), which is an XML-based image format used for defining vector-based graphics. SVG contains multiple elements that are part of the DOM (Document Object Model) tree. As the name suggests, DOM is a model where HTML code is presented as a tree structure of tags. It means that there are parenthood relationships between nodes: <html> is a root, and <head> or <body> are its children.
    - SVG has unlimited resolution, which means it can zoom in and out of diagrams with no limit, while canvas, being raster-based, has a set precision and so might lose image quality.    


# Issues
- Very expensive. And it's not free to learn JointJS+ (30 day trial). Also, maybe a developer license is needed.
